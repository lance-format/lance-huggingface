LanceDB huggingface datasets


## Data organization

You can either include a `README.md` with [dataset cards](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/datasets-cards)
directly in a raw Lance dataset, or adopt a Hugging Face–style directory structure,
placing Lance datasets for different splits in the `/data` directory:

```sh
/data/{train,eval}.lance
/README.md
```
